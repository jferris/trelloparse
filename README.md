# trelloparse

This parses plaintext Trello emails and attempts to re-print them in a way that
can actually be read by human beings.

## Install

You need the Haskell Platform.

You can install it by cloning the project, changing into the project directory,
and running `cabal install`.

This works with mutt as a `display_filter`.
